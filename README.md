# Hi thereğŸ‘‹

I'm a computer engineer currently studying and deeply passionate about creating from scratch. My interests lie in web development and game design, where I enjoy bringing ideas to life. I love building everything from small business to personal websites and crafting engaging games using Python, seamlessly integrating them into web design projects.
