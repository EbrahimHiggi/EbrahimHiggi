#### Development and Writing
![Development and Writing](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D4D16AQFwxxMX32NlKg/profile-displaybackgroundimage-shrink_200_800/0/1710755433231?e=1718841600&v=beta&t=zJ9u7T8bxTcVGsFqFpqrw1wSh3kWpRcJGjNFoX7xClQ)

I'm a computer engineering student with a strong passion for building projects from scratch. My primary focus is web development, where I enjoy turning ideas into fully functional websites â€” from personal portfolios to small business platforms. I also explore game development using Unity as a side interest, creating interactive experiences that sometimes complement my web projects. While I work on both fields, my core specialization is in web development.


Skills: Python / JS / HTML / CSS /  C#

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my own work.
